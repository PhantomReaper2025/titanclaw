## Implementation Plan Requirement

When your change affects a planned capability, update `implementation_plan.md` in the same branch.

### Required before opening a PR

1. Review the relevant sections in `implementation_plan.md`.
2. Update status/notes if behavior changed.
3. Include the `implementation_plan.md` diff in your commit when applicable.

## Canonical Docs Requirement

For behavior/UX/runtime changes, keep these docs synchronized:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `IDENTITY.md`
3. `README.md`
4. `implementation_plan.md`
5. `CHANGELOG.md`
